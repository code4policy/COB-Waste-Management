<!-- Definition -->

    	<h3 id="definition"> 1. What is Trash? </h3>

    	<p> Trash refers to unwanted, discarded or waste material that cannot be reused, repurposed or recycled.</p>

    	<p> To support the City of Boston's dedication to reducing our waste, we encourage you to manage your waste responsibly by minimizing the amount of trash you dispose of. </p>

    	<p> Before you throw away something in the trash, use our <a href=https://www.boston.gov/departments/public-works/trash-and-recycling-day-schedule-and-search> Reycling and Trash Directory</a> to check if it can be recycled, reused, or donated.</p>

    	<p> You can also use the Waste Sorting Tool on the Trash Day App to do this. You can find the App on <a href=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.recollect.boston&pli=1> Google Play</a> or <a href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boston-trash-schedule-alerts/id999579992> App Store</a>. </p>

<!-- non-Regular Trash Items -->

    	<h3 id="nonregular"> 2. How do we dispose of non-regular Trash? </h3>

<!-- Explanation of Zero Waste Days -->

    	<h4> Zero Waste Days </h4>

    	 <p> The City of Boston holds drop-off days to collect household hazardous materials and certain waste ban items on <a href=https://www.boston.gov/departments/public-works/zero-waste-day> Zero Waste Days</a>. </p> 

    	 <p> To dispose of such items, you need to provide a photo ID, utility bill, or lease as proof of residency. </p>
