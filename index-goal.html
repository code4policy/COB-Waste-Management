        <p id="highlight">* IMPORTANT NOTES ON THE DATA</p>
        <p> The City's goals are defined on a municipal-level which encompasses waste management at both residential and commercial levels.</p>
        <p> However, the current dashboard focuses solely on residential data, as commercial waste data is not yet available but will be added in the future. </p>
